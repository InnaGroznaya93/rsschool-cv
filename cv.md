## **Briefly about myself:**
I am a pianist by profession and work. A year and a half ago, I became interested in studying programming. Since November 2021 I started studying Java and English. In March 2022, I passed all the tests, interviews and passed the java training in epam. But because of the war, all trainings were suspended, and after some time only frontend courses began to appear. Therefore, since September 2022, I started studying frontend and I really hope that your school will help me with this :)
